## Creating a File Virtual Interface: LACP
To create a file virtual interface using LACP bonding, you need at least two physical Ethernet ports. Each pair must consist of different Ethernet ports on the same controller. For example, you can select the `ct0.eth4` and `ct0.eth5` physical Ethernet ports.

The recommended configuration is to use two LACP bonds, each with two physical Ethernet ports. Avoid using the `management` or `replication` physical Ethernet ports for LACP bond creation.
