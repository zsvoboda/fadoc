## Creating a File Virtual Interface: LACP

Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) is an IEEE standard that allows individual Ethernet links to be aggregated into a single logical Ethernet link. Depending on a on the scenario, it can be used to increase bandwidth utilization, increase availability, or simplify network configurations. In order for LACP to work with the FlashArray, the network switch must be configured for LACP as well.

To create a file virtual interface using LACP bonding, you need at least two physical Ethernet ports. Each pair must consist of different Ethernet ports on the same controller. For example, you can select the `ct0.eth4` and `ct0.eth5` physical Ethernet ports.

The recommended configuration is to use two LACP bonds, each with two physical Ethernet ports. Avoid using the `management` or `replication` physical Ethernet ports for LACP bond creation.
