# File Services Users and Groups

By default, FlashArray uses local users and groups. Alternatively, you can join your array to an Active Directory or LDAP domain to perform user and group resolution via a directory server. Please note that FlashArray currently does not support simultaneous lookups in both Active Directory and LDAP. Additionally, the SMB protocol does not support the LDAP directory server.

The local users and groups database serves as a fallback for directory service resolution. If a user or group cannot be found in the directory server, FlashArray will attempt to resolve it in the local user database.

For NFS protocol, there is a `User Mapping` configuration option. If this option is set to false, FlashArray will not perform any user lookup in either the local user database or the directory server (Active Directory or LDAP).
