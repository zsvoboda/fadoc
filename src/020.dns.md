# Configuring File Services DNS
FlashArray allows for mutiple DNS server configurations:

- **Management** DNS configuration is the default one and is used for resolution of all hostnames that array uses (e.g. SMTP servers, other arrays, etc.). If there is no File Services-specific DNS configuration, these DNS servers are used for resolution of File Services hostnames (e.g. hostnames in the Active Directory). FlashArray allows for only one management DNS configuration.
- **File** DNS configuration is used for resoultion of hostnames related to File Services. This File Services-specific DNS configuration often uses domain controller's DNS server that contains DNS records for all hostnames used in the Active Directory. FlashArray allows for only one file DNS configuration.
