# Creating a File Virtual Interface
FlashArray File Services uses a virtual interface to communicate with client computers for both resiliency and performance. The File Service virtual interface (also known as a file VIF) consists of four or more physical Ethernet ports across both array controllers. This design protects the array from individual port or network link failures, as well as from controller failures.

FlashArray supports two different file virtual interface configurations:
- **Physical Bonding**: The file virtual interface uses pairs of the same physical ports on both controllers. For example, `ct0.eth4` and `ct1.eth4`, or `ct0.eth5` and `ct1.eth5`.
- **LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol) Bonding**: The file virtual interface uses a pair of LACP virtual interfaces, each on a different controller. An LACP virtual interface can use up to four physical Ethernet ports on the same controller. For example, `ct0.eth4` and `ct0.eth5`.
> **Note**: Your network infrastructure (switches and routers) must support the LACP standard (IEEE 802.3ad).

The LACP configuration is preferred over physical bonding.
