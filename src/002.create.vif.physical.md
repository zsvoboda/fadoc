## Creating a File Virtual Interface: Physical Bonding
To create a file virtual interface using physical bonding, you need at least one pair of physical Ethernet ports. The pair must consist of the same physical Ethernet ports on different controllers. For example, you can select the `ct0.eth4` and `ct1.eth4` physical ports.

The recommended configuration is to use two pairs of physical Ethernet ports in the file virtual interface setup. Avoid using the `management` or `replication` physical Ethernet ports for file virtual interface creation.
