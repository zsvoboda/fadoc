# Joining Active Directory Domain

FlashArray can authenticate SMB and NFS users against an Active Directory domain. To do this, you must first create an account for the FlashArray in your target Active Directory domain.

The `Active Directory Accounts` configuration widget is located on the `Settings/ACCESS/Users And Policies` page.

Click on the `+` button in the top right corner of the widget.

You can either create a new computer account for your array:

or use an existing computer account in your Active Directory:

## Joining LDAP

Alternatively, you can also join an LDAP domain from the `Directory Service` widget on the same configuration page. 

Be aware that FlashArray currently supports the LDAP authentication only for the NFS protocol. Also LDAP and Active Directory can't be used at the same time.
