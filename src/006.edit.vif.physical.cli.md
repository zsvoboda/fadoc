#### Edit and Enable the File Virtual Interface using CLI
Next, configure the netmask and gateway for the new interface:

```bash
purenetwork eth setattr --netmask 255.255.255.0 --gateway 192.168.1.1 filevif0
```

Finally, enable the new interface:

```bash
purenetwork eth enable filevif0
```

You can double-check that the file virtual interface has been successfully created by listing its details:

```bash
purenetwork eth list filevif0
Name      Enabled  Type  Subnet  Address        Mask           Gateway      MTU   MAC                Speed       Services  Subinterfaces

                                                                                                                           ct1.eth4
                                                                                                                           ct0.eth5
                                                                                                                           ct1.eth5
```

If you no longer need the file virtual interface, you can delete it with the following command:

```bash
purenetwork eth delete filevif0
```
