# Array Local Users and Groups

FlashArray File Local Users and Groups is a feature that allows for a locally stored directory of users and groups, providing an alternative to external authentication solutions such as Active Directory or LDAP. By using local users and groups, clients can connect to the FlashArray File domain via SMB or NFS and authenticate with their respective credentials.

**NOTE:** For NFS, another option is to use an export policy with unmapped users (`--disable-user-mapping`). This allows local users on clients to access the NFS exports without user or group validation. FlashArray fully trusts the NFS client's user credentials (UID, GID, and secondary GIDs).

## Local Users

Each local user is a member of one primary group. Before creating a user, a primary group must exist for that user. A user can also be a member of other groups, referred to as secondary groups.

An admin should be a member of the Administrators group. Backup operators should be members of the Backup Operators group.

FlashArray contains the following built-in users, which cannot be modified or removed:

- **Administrator** (uid=0) is used for array configuration and management.
- **Guest** (uid=65534) is used for anonymous access. This account is disabled by default.

**NOTE:** NFS squashing capability changes the user identity to the anonymous user. The default uid for the anonymous user in NFS policy rules is 65534. Ensure that the user with uid 65534 is defined. You can create such a user in Active Directory or LDAP or rely on the `Guest` local user. In this case, you must explicitly enable the `Guest` user.

## Local Groups

A local group can have many members, but only local users can be members of a local group (not other groups). Before deleting a local group, all members must be removed from the group.

Local groups can also contain external users (from Active Directory or LDAP).

FlashArray contains the following built-in groups, which cannot be modified or removed:

- **Administrators** (gid=0) contains users with administrative privileges.
- **Guests** (gid=65534) contains guest users.
- **Backup Operators** contains users responsible for backup and archival tasks.

## Managing Local Users and Groups using GUI

Navigate to the `Settings/Access/File Services` configuration page to review the local users and groups.

## Managing Local Users and Groups using CLI

Please refer to the `pureds` command in the CLI reference documentation.

```bash
pureds local user -h
usage: pureds local user [-h] {add,create,delete,disable,enable,list,remove,rename,setattr} ...

positional arguments:
  {add,create,delete,disable,enable,list,remove,rename,setattr}
    list                list users
    create              create one or more users
    delete              delete one or more users
    add                 add the user to one or more groups
    remove              remove the user from one or more groups
    enable              enable one or more users
    disable             disable one or more users
    rename              rename user
    setattr             set attributes of the user 
```

Here are a few examples of how to use the pureds command:

List all local users:

```bash
pureds local user list
```

List a local group with a specific SID:

```bash
pureds local group list --sid S-1-5-32-544
```

Create a new local user:

1. Use the `pureds local user create` command to create a new user. 

```bash
pureds local user create <username>
```

Replace <username> with the desired username for the new user.

2. Set additional attributes for the user, if needed: 

```bash
pureds local user setattr <username> --primary-group <groupname> --password --uid <uid> --email <email>
```

Replace <username>, <groupname>, <uid>, and <email> with the appropriate values.

3. Add the user to one or more groups:

```bash
pureds local user add <username> --group <groupname>
```

Replace <username> and <groupname> with the appropriate values.

4. Enable the user (if they are not enabled by default):

```bash
pureds local user enable <username>
```

5. Verify the user creation by listing the users:

```bash
pureds local user list
```

## Referencing Local Users and Groups from Clients

SMB clients refer to local users using their local username and the domain name 'domain'. For example, when mapping a drive from Windows, use the `domain\<local-user-name>` format.

![Windows User Login](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsvoboda/fadoc/refs/heads/main/src/img/local.users/windows.login.dialog.png)

In this example, `zsvoboda` is the local user that has been previously created on the array. This user is a member of the `Administrators` group.

To execute Computer Management on Windows, use the following command:

```cmd
runas /noprofile /netonly /user:domain\zsvoboda "mmc compmgmt.msc"
```
**NOTE:** You must execute the Windows command prompt with the `Run as administrator` option.

Connect to the FlashArray using the file virtual interface IP address:

![Windows Computer Management Connect](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsvoboda/fadoc/refs/heads/main/src/img/local.users/computer.management.login.png)

From there, you can explore the array settings, such as SMB shares, sessions, open files, or array local users:

![Windows Computer Management Users](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsvoboda/fadoc/refs/heads/main/src/img/local.users/computer.management.users.png)

Similarly, when mounting an SMB share from a Linux client, use the following command: 

```bash
mount -t cifs -o user=zsvoboda,domain=domain,vers=3,uid=1000 //192.168.1.231/home /mnt/home
```

On the Windows command line, use:

```cmd
net use Z: \\192.168.1.231\home /user:domain\zsvoboda
```

### Changing Windows Security Settings (ACL)

When setting Windows share, directory, or individual file permissions (also known as ACLs), refer to local users using the format `<file-virtual-network-ip-or-hostname>\<local-user_name>`.

For example:

1. Right-click on the Windows mapped drive and select `Properties` from the drop-down menu.

![Windows Explorer Mapped Drive Properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsvoboda/fadoc/refs/heads/main/src/img/local.users/explorer.share.png)

2. In the properties dialog, navigate to the `Security` tab and click on the `Edit` button to add a new user to the list.

![Security Properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsvoboda/fadoc/refs/heads/main/src/img/local.users/security.properties.png)

3. Click the `Add` button to add a FlashArray local user to the list.

4. Refer to the `zsvoboda` local user as `192.168.1.231\zsvoboda`.

![Users](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsvoboda/fadoc/refs/heads/main/src/img/local.users/users.png)

5. Change the share access permissions for the array local user `zsvoboda`.
