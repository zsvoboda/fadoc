# Configuring File Services DNS using GUI

The DNS configuration widget is located on the `Settings/NETWORK/Configuration` page. By default, it contains the default management DNS configuration. If no additional configuration is specified, this DNS configuration is used for File Services.

You can edit the default DNS configuration; however, this is not recommended as it is likely used for array management.

In many cases, the default DNS server used by the array cannot resolve File Services-related hostnames defined in Active Directory. In such cases, you may need to use a different DNS configuration specifically for File Services.

To add a File Services-specific DNS configuration, click the `+` button in the DNS widget on the `Settings/NETWORK/Configuration` page.

Select the `file` checkbox for this DNS configuration.

**NOTE:** FlashArray allows only one `management` DNS configuration and one `file` DNS configuration.

The default network interface for communication with the DNS server is the `eth0` management Ethernet port. If this default network port cannot communicate with the File Services-specific DNS servers, you can use a different virtual network interface. In many cases, you would use your file virtual network interface, as the Windows domain serverâ€™s DNS and Active Directory are typically on the same network.
