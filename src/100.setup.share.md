# Creating the First Share

Once you've set up File Services, you can start sharing your directories over SMB or NFS protocols. Here are the high-level steps you need to follow:

- **Create a File System**: The container for the files and directories that you're going to share.
- **Create an export policy**: The configuration for your SMB or NFS sharing over the network.
- **Create an export**: The representation of a directory that is shared over the network via SMB or NFS protocols.
- **Set SMB share permissions**: to define access to the shared directory.  
- **Access the SMB share or NFS export from your clients**: map (Windows) or mount (Unix/Linux) the shared directory from a remote client computer over SMB or NFS protocols. 

## Multi-Protocol Access

FlashArray supports simultaneous access from both SMB and NFS clients to the same directory. This for example means you can have Windows users accessing files via SMB, and Linux users accessing the same files via NFS.

The array manages permissions and access control by mapping SMB ACLs to Unix mode bits (and vice versa), ensuring smooth interoperability. 

## Create a New File System

Creating a File System is the first step that you need to perform before sharing files. A File System is the primary storage container where your files are going to be stored. You can think of it as a disk or, more precisely, a disk partition. You can create a new File System via CLI or GUI.

### Creating a New File System via CLI

You can perform many operations on your File System using the `purefs` command. For example, you can create a new File System using: 

```bash
purefs create AcmeData
```

Later, you can list all File Systems using: 

```bash
purefs list 
```

Or remove your File System using:

```bash
purefs destroy AcmeData 
```

Please note that FlashArray uses a two-phase deletion process for removing many block and file artifacts. We call this process destroy/eradicate, and you can think of the destroy command as dumping the File System to a recycle bin. Later, you can restore your File System from the recycle bin via the `purefs recover` command or permanently delete a destroyed File System using the `purefs eradicate` command. 

The `purefs list` command lists all available File Systems on your array. 

### Creating a New File System via GUI

To create a new File System using the FlashArray GUI, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your FlashArray's hostname or management IP address and log in with your credentials.
2. In the left-hand navigation pane, click on **Storage** and **Go to the"File Systems" Tab** 
3. **Click on "+" button in the File Systems Widget**

![Create File System](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsvoboda/fadoc/refs/heads/main/src/img/use/storage.create.filesystem.png)

4. Enter a name for your new File System (e.g., `AcmeFileSystem`).

![Create File System Dialog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsvoboda/fadoc/refs/heads/main/src/img/use/create.filesystem.png)

5. **Click "Create"**: Your new File System will now be available for use.

## Create Managed Directory

Managed directories allow administrators to control the organization and structure of directories under a File System. With FlashArray, you can create, manage, and set policies for directories in a way that scales efficiently. 

### Key Considerations for Managed Directories

- Managed directories offer **fine-grained control** over file system organization and access.
- There is a default `:root` managed directory that gets automatically created when the File System is created.
- Managed directories **are not case-sensitive**, making them more flexible in environments with mixed case usage.
- You can have **up to 8 levels** of directory hierarchy, though many customers often use only a single level.

### Creating a New Managed Directory via CLI

To create a managed directory within a File System, use the following command:

```bash
puredir create --path /home AcmeFileSystem:home
```

This will create a new managed directory named `home` within the `AcmeData` File System.

To list all managed directories in a File System:

```bash
puredir list
```

**NOTE**: Notice the `AcmeFileSystem:root` managed directory that has been created automatically upon the `AcmeFileSystem` File System creation. 

To remove a managed directory:

```bash
puredir delete AcmeFileSystem:home
```

### Creating a New Managed Directory via GUI

1. In the left-hand navigation pane, click on **Storage** and **Go to the"File Systems" Tab**
2. **Click on "+" button in the Directories Widget** to create a new Managed Directory.

3. **Specify the new Managed Directory File System, Name, and Path**: You can create a new managed directory by specifying a File System where it will be created, it's name, and path within the File System. 

![Create MD Dialog ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsvoboda/fadoc/refs/heads/main/src/img/use/create.md.png)

4. **Click "Create"**: Your new Managed Directory will now be available for use.

## Export Policy

An export policy configures how a managed directory is shared over network. It specifies various SMB and NFS parameters like security options, encryption, protocol version, etc.

There is one important NFS export policy parameter called `User Mapping` that controls authentication for NFS clients. In case when it is disabled, the user UID and GID that come from the NFS client are not validated against any user database (e.g. local users database, Active Directory, or LDAP)

### Export Policy Rules

Export policy rules further define configuration for specific clients or groups of clients. They allow administrators to specify which clients can access shared directories and define their level of access. 

Client specification within these rules can be based on individual IP addresses, IP ranges (using CIDR notation), or fully qualified domain names (FQDNs). This flexibility ensures that administrators can precisely control who accesses a share. 

For example, you can grant access to a single client using an IP address like 192.168.1.10, or to an entire subnet by specifying 192.168.1.0/24.  

Export policy rules enable granular control across different access requirements, such as providing read-only access to some clients while allowing full read-write access to others. These rules help create a secure and structured access environment for file sharing across both SMB and NFS protocols.

The star rule (*) is a wildcard used in export policies to represent any client. This rule grants access to all clients that attempt to connect to a share, regardless of their IP address or hostname. The star rule is often used when administrators want to allow open access to a file share, typically in environments where ease of access is prioritized over stringent security controls.

For example, an export policy with a client specification of * allows any client, from any network, to access the share. While this provides convenience, it should be used carefully in production environments, as it can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users if not paired with other restrictions, such as specific permissions (e.g., read-only access).

The star rule is particularly useful in testing or internal environments where access restrictions are not a primary concern, but it should be avoided in situations requiring strict security and access control. Instead, administrators can combine the star rule with more granular permission settings to mitigate potential security risks.

**NOTE**: The export policy requires at least one rule to allow access to at least one client. We'll use one '*' rule that allows access to all clients for our testing purposes.

### Creating an Export Policy via CLI

To create an NFS or SMB export policy, you can use the `purepolicy` command. Here’s an example of how to create an SMB export policy:

For SMB:

```bash
purepolicy smb create AcmeSmbPolicy
```

For NFS:

```bash
purepolicy nfs create AcmeNfsPolicy

# this disables user validation against local users database, Active Directory, or LDAP
puprepolicy disable --user-mapping AcmeNfsPolicy
```

### Creating an Export Policy via GUI

1. In the left-hand navigation pane, click on **Storage** and **Go to the"Policies" Tab**
2. **Click on "+" button in the Export policies** to create a new export policy.

![Policy List](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsvoboda/fadoc/refs/heads/main/src/img/use/policy.list.png)

3. **Specify the new policy Name, and Path**: You can create a new managed directory by specifying a File System where it will be created, it's name, and path within the File System. 

![Create NFS Policy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsvoboda/fadoc/refs/heads/main/src/img/use/create.nfs.policy.png)

**NOTE**: Note the `User Mapping` option described above. 

![Create SMB Policy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsvoboda/fadoc/refs/heads/main/src/img/use/create.smb.policy.png)

4. **Click "Create"**: Your new export policies will now be available for use.


### Creating an Export Policy Rules via CLI

You can use the same `purepolicy` command for creation of the export policy rules. For example, to add a rule that gives all clients `read-only` root-squashed access to an NFS3 export:

For NFS: 

```bash
purepolicy nfs rule add --client "*" --ro --root-squash --version nfsv3 --security auth_sys AcmeNfsPolicy
```

or 

For SMB: 

```bash
purepolicy smb rule add --client "*" AcmeSmbPolicy
```
### Creating an Export Policy Rules via GUI

1. In the left-hand navigation pane, click on **Storage** and **Go to the"Policies" Tab**
2. **Select a policy that you want to create a rule for** by clicking on it's record in the Export Policies List.

![Select Policy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsvoboda/fadoc/refs/heads/main/src/img/use/select.policy.png)

3. **Click on the "+" button in the Rules widget** to create a new export policy rule.

![Policy Detail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsvoboda/fadoc/refs/heads/main/src/img/use/policy.detail.png)

4. Specify the policy rule `Client` specification to identify the client that the configuration is applied to ("*" in our case) and the specific parameters of this configuration. 

For NFS: 
![NFS Policy Rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsvoboda/fadoc/refs/heads/main/src/img/use/nfs.policy.rule.png)

For SMB:

5. **Click "Add"**: Your new export policy rule will now be available for use.

**NOTE**: Please note that at least one rule must be defined for each export policy.

## Creating an Export

Once you’ve created your File System and defined your export policies, and rules, the next step is to create the export itself. An export is what makes your File System accessible to clients over the network.

An export is created by attaching a specific export policy (either SMB or NFS or both) to a managed directory.

### Creating an Export via CLI

To export your File System over NFS:

```bash
puredir export create --dir AcmeFileSystem:home --policy AcmeNfsPolicy home
```

To export over SMB:

```bash
puredir export create --dir AcmeFileSystem:home --policy AcmeSmbPolicy home
```

### Creating an Export via GUI

1. In the left-hand navigation pane, click on **Storage** and **Go to the"File Systems" Tab**
2. **Click on "+" button in the Directory Exports**.

![Create Export](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsvoboda/fadoc/refs/heads/main/src/img/use/storage.create.export.png)

3. **Specify the Managed Directory that you want to export and the SMB, and/or NFS Policies** to specify the export access details via the SMB and NFS protocols. 

![Create Export Dialog ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsvoboda/fadoc/refs/heads/main/src/img/use/create.export.png)

4. **Click "Create"**: Your new export will now be available for use.

## Setting SMB Share Permissions

SMB shares allow for granular control of access, using Access Control Lists (ACLs). You can manage the SMB Share Permissions via the Windows Computer Management tool.

1. Start the `Computer Management` in your Windows environment.

![Start MMC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsvoboda/fadoc/refs/heads/main/src/img/use/start.mmc.png)

2. Connect to FlashArray via the File Services Virtual Interface

![MMC Connect FA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsvoboda/fadoc/refs/heads/main/src/img/use/mmc.connect.to.fa.png)

3. Specify the FlashArray's File Services Virtual Interface IP or hostname. 

![MMC Connect FA Dialog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsvoboda/fadoc/refs/heads/main/src/img/use/mmc.connect.fa.dialog.png)

4. Access the `home` SMB share properties in the `System Tools/Shared Folders/Shares` folder.

![MMC Share Properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsvoboda/fadoc/refs/heads/main/src/img/use/mmc.share.properties.png)

4. Set the desired permissions in the `Share Permissions` tab.

**NOTE:** Please refer to the [Local User Documentation](./031.local.users.md) to find out details regarding referencing local users (use `domain\<user-name>` format) in case when you are using them.

## Accessing the SMB or NFS Export from Clients

Once you’ve created and configured your SMB or NFS export, clients can begin accessing it.

### Accessing SMB Shares from Windows

1. **Open Windows Explorer**: In the address bar, type:

   ```
   \\<FlashArray_IP>\<Share_Name>
   ```

   For example:

   ```
   \\192.168.1.60\home
   ```

2. **Enter your credentials**: If prompted, enter your credentials to access the share.

Alternatively, you can use the Windows Ccommand line:

```cmd
net use <drive-letter>: \\<FlashArray-IP-or-Hostname>\<export-name>  /user:<username> <password>
```

For example:

```cmd
net use z: \\192.168.1.60\home /user:domain\zsvoboda <password>
```

**NOTE:** Please refer to the [Local User Documentation](./031.local.users.md) to find out details regarding referencing local users in case when you are using them.


### Accessing NFS Exports from Linux/Unix

1. **Mount the NFS export**: Run the following command on your Linux or Unix client:

   ```bash
   sudo mount -t nfs <FlashArray-IP-or-Hostname>:/<export-name> <mount-directory>
   ```

   For example:

   ```
   sudo mount -t nfs 192.168.1.60:/home /mnt/home
   ```

   This will mount the NFS export to the `/mnt` directory.
